\section{Experience}

\cventry{Mar 2018--Present}{Senior Software Developer}{Ethereum
Foundation}{Remote}{}{Part of the ``Snake Charmers'' team within the Foundation
which is focused on applied Python development and maintenance of open source
Python projects.  We are distinguished from but collaborate with Foundation
research teams to implement next generation protocol and smart contract
research.  That includes work on the open source Python Ethereum client,
\href{https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm.git}{Trinity}, and related libraries
as well as work on smart contract development tools such as the
\href{https://github.com/ethereum/vyper.git}{Vyper} compiler.}

\cventry{Nov 2013--Mar 2018}{Senior Software Developer}{Specialized Bicycle
Components (Ret\"ul)}{Boulder, CO}{}{Developed REST API services for data
collection from digital measurement devices.  Services written in Python
(Django Framework) and deployed as Docker containers on Heroku.  Some services
also deployed to cloud-hosted Linux VPS (configuration managed with Salt
Stack).  Used NumPy and Pandas libraries to implement proprietary search and
data analysis routines.  Administered all Ret\"ul department web services.
Developed pressure point detection algorithm for pressure reading device.
Built continuous integration pipeline using Docker and CircleCI.  Researched
deep learning techniques and possible applications.  Mentored junior devs and
conducted code review.}

\cventry{Jan 2012--Nov 2013}{Software Developer}{Fusionbox}{Denver,
CO}{}{Developed web apps and APIs with Python (Django framework).  Developed
single page front-ends using Angular.js and Backbone.js.  Was responsible for
every aspect of project development (except graphic design), deployment, and
runtime environment provisioning.  Deployed projects via Fabric (Python) to
cloud-hosted Linux VPSs (configuration managed with Puppet).  Apps were served
via Lighttpd and Uwsgi.}
